# ref-plant-viruses

*An official Virtool reference for plant viruses*

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/virtool/ref-plant-viruses/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/virtool/ref-plant-viruses)

## Description

This database consists of primarily of all curated plant virus genomes as
[published by NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=10239). There are some other additions
in the form of:

- viroid sequences
- additional isolates for NCBI-sourced viruses described above

## Versioning

The plant virus reference follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We will only increment the major version for the reference if a new release break backwards compatibility.

The reference releases in this repository are only supported in Virtool v3.0.0 and later. 

## Contributing

If you want to contribute more information to this database, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/virtool/ref-plant-viruses/issues/new) describing the addition.

We will move to a pull request-based contribution system as soon as possible.
